## Terminal

The Terminal is a text based interface that is included with your operating system. It is used for running commands, executing programs, opening documents, working with directories, and much more. When working in the Terminal, the current directory that is being utilized is referred to as the __working directory__. The reason that we care about this application is because it allows us to perform actions that we cannot complete when using the GUI. As a developer this will be extremely useful because it will allow us to complete activities using commands, which means we do not have to spend time clicking around in the GUI to find what we are looking for.

## Git and GitHub

__Git__ is a text based program that we install into our Terminal. Git refers to the most popular version control system. It tracks changes that are made to your files over time, allowing you to keep a record of what has been done. This allows us as developers to revert to specific versions whenever necessary. It allows for collaboration between multiple developers or even an entire team, allowing changes by multiple developers to be merged into a single source.

 __GitHub__ is a code hosting platform that allows us to store our code, along with details of each commit, make comments, and work with like minded people to develop solutions. GitHub facilitates the interactions of it's users and allows us to discuss errors, and also to share or reuse code that other people have authored. This set of tools that are provided with GitHub will be extremely useful for us as developers because we can store and access our code from anywhere. Our GitHub profiles are basically a developers portfolio for future opportunities and employment.

## GitHub CLI and Visual Studio Code

This week we learned about the *GitHub CLI*, which is a component that is added to your Terminal to use for completing *git* related activities. The GitHub CLI is much more powerful than the GitHub Desktop, which uses the Graphical User Interface. We ran a command to authenticate our GitHub CLI with our GitHub account. We practiced numerous commands inside the GitHub CLI. Some of the most basic commands are:

* __cd__ : This command is used to change the directory to your home directory. Or a path can be provided after the command to specify the location in your directory that you wish to be working in.
* __ls__ : This is used to list the contents of you current location in the directory.
* __history__ : Use this command to display all of the commands that you have run inside of the GitHub CLI.
* __clear__ : This clears the screen of all of your work from the current session.
* __pwd__ : Print working directory lets you know the location of where you are currently working.

We then moved on to learn some additional *git* commands that we use to make commits and other changes to our code in our local directory. We also pushed the changes to the remote repository on GitHub. Some of those commands that we used include:

* __git clone (url)__ : This command will allow you to clone a repository from GitHub to your local computer.
* __git status__ : This command will show you the current state of your repository.
* __git add__ : This command will add all of your changes to the staging area.
* __git add (filename)__ : This will allow you to add a specific file to the staging area.
* __git commit -m__ : This command will commit your changes to your local repository. The __-m__ flag is a flag that allows you to add a message to your commit.
* __log__ : This command will show you your recent commits.
* __q__ : This command is used to exit from the log screen.
* __git push__ : This command will push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.
* __git commit --amend__ : This can be used to modify __the last commit__ that you made.

In addition to GitHub CLI, we also learned a few new keyboard shortcuts and commands to use with *Visual Studio Code*.

* __code .__ : This command when ran inside of the GitHub CLI will open up Visual Studio Code in your current working directory.
* __Ctl + Shift + P__ : This keyboard shortcut will open a list of commands inside of __VS Code__ so that you can search for commands to choose from.
* __Ctl + P__ : This keyboard shortcut will activate *Quick Open*, which will give you a list of recently opened files to choose from.

## Learning to Write Meaningful Commit Messages

This week we learned that there are specific rules that should be followed when writing our commit messages. When authoring commit messages, ensure that you meet the following criteria:

1. The message should be clean and concise, or short and sweet.
2. Messages should be meaningful and descriptive in regards to the code that you are committing at that very moment.
3. Commit messages should begin with a __Verb__ in the *imperative tense*.
4. Messages should begin with a capital letter.
5. Messages should not contain punctuation at the end of the sentence.

This is my summary of what we learned this week. I am excited to learn to use these powerful tools. I also just got access to the Student Developer Pack, so I have been exploring all of the exciting offers that GitHub provides for verified students.
